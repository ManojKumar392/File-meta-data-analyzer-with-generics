Uncle Vernon was big and beefy, and looked even more enormous than usual surrounded by the little, dark-haired people. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In fact, Vernon Dursley was about as un-Dursleyish as it was possible to be.
